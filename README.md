changes according to lectuer feedback : Made a better readme file as i was requested to be more detailed in my readme folder. in the files for this GitHub repo there is a screenshot of commits showing that my commits are higher than 15 . my program now accepsts doubles now making program more versitile and less likly to crash or throw an error . more colour was added to make the prompts for the user stand out more . made comments more concise and understandable as there were times it was hard ti see differeances between code and comments. better variable names as before it was slightly confusing and illogical. removed duplicate variable names as to make the program read better but also to make it more intuitive.
